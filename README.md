# todolist-angularjs

> A simple todolist webapp made with AngularJS.

This is the very first webapp I ever made. Many, many years ago.  
Back then I thought that AngularJS would be a framework for the future.  
But AngularJS is dead now.

Nevertheless, I tried to modernize it a tiny bit and get it running again.
I didn't change much, just the build process and the way dependencies are
managed (yeah, I used to upload `node_modules` back then...).  
The code is still as bad as it was :D
